## Performance — measured on the production machine

- Answer generation runs on a 15 W mobile CPU with **no GPU acceleration**. This laptop is the production machine; there is no faster environment later.
- A single LLM answer over a full RAG context measured **195 seconds**. This is why the system defaults to a **no-LLM Tier 1 path** that returns the quoted source passage in 1–2 seconds.
- LLM synthesis (Tier 2) remains materially slower than Tier 1 and is an explicit, opt-in action.
- Ingestion is paused during demonstrations; running it concurrently invalidates latency figures.

## Scope not implemented

- **OCR is not implemented.** Scanned pages are detected and flagged, not read. A scanned document will not be searchable.
- **No ANN index** — brute-force vector search. Correct and fast at prototype scale; requires an index before full-corpus use.
- **Perfect table and diagram extraction is not claimed** for every PDF type.
- **No authentication, RBAC, SSO, high availability, disaster recovery, or enterprise key management.**
- **No domain fine-tuning**, and no production accuracy claim.
- **Full corpus not ingested.** ~45 GB free disk does not accommodate ~1.2 M pages.

## Security and governance

- ⚠️ **This is a locally-inferencing system on a networked machine. It is NOT air-gapped.** Client document content never leaves the machine, but the machine has internet access.
- The repository is private but on GitHub **free tier**, where four controls are **unenforceable** and must not be described as enforced:
  - No direct pushes to `main`
  - No force pushes to `main`
  - Required status checks before merge
  - GitHub Advanced Security secret scanning
- Compensating controls are in place: gitleaks in CI **and** as a pre-commit hook, plus a CI guard rejecting client documents. These are verified by deliberate failure tests.
- "No document content leaves the machine" reduces exfiltration exposure. It does **not** remove malicious-PDF, local-account, disk-theft, dependency, or privilege-escalation risk.
- **Saudi Aramco security architecture and data-classification review remains a production gate.**

## Measurement honesty

- No accuracy or throughput figure is claimed without a recorded benchmark in `docs/benchmarks.md`, stating hardware, corpus, version, and sample size.
- Domain accuracy cannot be claimed until the client supplies answerable and unanswerable questions with expected page evidence.
